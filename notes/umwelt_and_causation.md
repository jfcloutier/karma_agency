# Umwelt and causation

The umwelt of a GM actor is the set of observed and latent objects presumed responsible for its sensations.

The GM actor's perception of the umwelt (what the GM actor believes about latent objects given past and present sensations, in the context of feeling dynamics) is relativistic. There is no (a priori) external frame of reference in which the agent and latent object are positioned.

So how does a GM actor distinguish changes to its perceptions caused by the agent vs those caused by the latent objects? How do I know when I move my eyes that the room is not moving?

If sensation dynamics attributed to an object do not correlate to agent action, then the object is the cause. Otherwise the agent is the cause.
