# SOM

## Structure

The SOM is a hierarchichal collective of cognition actors (CAs), managed by metacognition actors (meta-CAs), that animate an agent.

## Cognition Actors

Each CA has an umwelt composed of a small number of CAs from the level below.

A CA synthesizes its beliefs from predicted observations, past and current, of the beliefs in its umwelt.

The beliefs of a CA exist in the context of wellbeing measures, current and trending. The wellbeing measures are fullness, integrity and engagement. They signal risks, present or absent, to the survivability of the entire collective of CAs. Beliefs associated with high risks are unpleasant. Beliefs associated with low risks are pleasant. Others are neutral. A CA acts on its umwelt in response to the pleasantness or unpleasantness of its current beliefs.

A CA operates one time frame after another. Each time frame corresponds to a "thick now". The time frame of a CA starts and stops independently of other CAs; time frames are not synchronized. CAs higher up in the collective's hierarchy have longer time frames. During its current time frame, a CA makes new observations by predicting the latest beliefs in its umwelt, reads the global wellbeing measures, refreshes its set of beliefs by integrating the latest observations with past ones, and assigns up-to-date normative values (pleasantness/unpleasantness) to its updated beliefs.

At the end of the current time frame, a CA decides whether to act on its updated beliefs and, if so, how.

## Metacognition actors

A meta-CA adds and removes CAs at the hierarchical level it manages (the level is made up of its "ward" CAs).

## Contraints

* Bottom-up constraints
  * Level N -1 CAs determine what the level N CAs can observe and do. They...
    * define the set of observations (beliefs they hold) and made available to the level N CAs which umwelts they compose
    * define the set of policies they constructed known to the level N CAs which umwelts they compose
* Top-down constraints
  * A Level N + 1 CA
    * models the (Level N) CAs in its umwelt but not vice-versa
      * umwelt CAs can't make sense of what's asked of/imposed on them - they simply accept it (Froese's Irruption Theory?)
    * reduces the agency of its umwelt
      * restricts the causal theory search space of umwelt CAs (by imposing restriction on the vocabulary used)
        * they can not "unground"" parent CA's beliefs (by disappearing the vocabulary of umwelt beliefs used by the parent CAs to synthesize beliefs)
          * this imposes constraints on signatures of causal theories
            * the choice of abduced objects/predicates is reduced
        * impose directives (policies to execute or goals to achieve) on Level N CAs to achieve its own goals
          * umwelt CAs decide how to fulfill received directives (they are not micromanaged, just directed)
          * they can't fulfill their own goals while fulfilling their parent CA's goals
            * they have fewer opportunity to intend their own goals and work on being/staying relevant
    * is in a better position than its umwelt to keep the agent alive if
      * it can detect the more abstract observation patterns that are more likely to correlate with wellbeing trends
      * and thus can set goals (to persist/terminate its beliefs) that will be more effective at maintaining the entire SOM alive
